## Current functionalities:

- Cube visualization in 3D (in any NxNxN size):
  - Cube outer layers can be rotated using the corresponding keys;
  - Cube can be reset to its original solved state.
- Scramble generations:
  - Works with every cube size.
- Timer.
- Kociemba's algorithm (usually finds a solution in 20-22 moves only 3x3x3).
- Cube rotation animation.

## Usage

Because we are using Raylib and RayGui, make sure the following libraries are installed:

```
libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev
```

Run the following commands to compile and run the project:

```bash
./build.sh && ./rubiks
```
